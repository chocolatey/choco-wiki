# Getting Started
## Using chocolatey
Now that you have chocolatey on your machine ([[need to install?|Installation]]), you can run several commands.

Take a look at the [[command reference|CommandsReference]]. We are going to be using the [[install command|CommandsInstall]].

Let's install [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

1. Open a command line.
1. Type `choco install notepadplusplus` and press Enter.
1. If you have UAC turned on or are not an administrator, chocolatey is going to request administrative permission at some point (at least once during the process). Otherwise it will not be able to finish what it is doing successfully. If you don't have UAC turned on, it will just continue on without stopping to bother you.
1. That's it. Pretty simple but powerful little concept!

### Overriding default install directory or other advanced install concepts

1. Yes we support that through the use of installargs - see [[CommandsInstall#installarguments]]
1. If you wanted to pass native argument to the installer, like the install directory, you would need to know the silent argument passed to that particular installer and then you would specify it on the command line or in the packages.config (upcoming for packages.config).
1. If it was an MSI, then usually you could pass `-ia 'INSTALLDIR=''D:\Program Files'''` (note the double `'` - those get translated to double quotes `"`, posh seems to want to rip them out.
1. For example, Notepad++ uses the [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) (NullSoft Scriptable Install System) installer. If we look at the silent options, we see that [/D](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter3.html#installerusagecommon) is how we influence the install directory. So we would pass `cinst notepadplusplus.install -ia '/D=E:\SomeDirectory\somebody\npp'` -note that we are looking at the specific package over the virtual (this will be corrected in future releases).

## How does Chocolatey work?
How the heck does this all work?

### Installation

1. Chocolatey uses Nuget.Core to retrieve the package from the source.
2. Choco determines if it self-contained or has automation scripts - PowerShell scripts (*.ps1 files), and soon to be open to Scriptcs files in the `0.9.10.x` timeframe (I know, right?!).
3. Choco takes a registry snapshot for later comparison.
4. If there are automation scripts, choco will run those. They can contain whatever you need to do, if they are PowerShell you have the full power of Posh (PowerShell), but you should try to ensure they are compatible with Posh v2+.
5. Choco compares the snapshot and determines uninstaller information and saves that to a .registry file.
6. Choco snapshots the folder based on all files that are currently in the package directory.
7. Choco looks for shim files and generates shims into the `$env:ChocolateyInstall\bin` folder so those items are available on the path.

### Upgrade

1. Similar to install, except choco will make a backup of the folder prior to attempting upgrade.
2. The files snapshot is used to determine what files can be removed from the package folder. If those files have not changed, they will be removed.

### Uninstall

1. Choco makes the determination that the package is actually installed.
2. Choco will make a backup of the folder.
3. The automation script is run if found. This should be used to clean up anything that is put there with the install script.
4. If auto uninstaller is turned on, choco will attempt to run the auto uninstaller if a silent uninstall can be determined. Otherwise it will prompt the user (unless -y) to ask if they want the uninstaller to continue. The auto uninstaller can automatically detect about 80% of the different native uninstallers and determine or use the silent uninstall arguments.
5. If everything is successful so far, the files snapshot is used to determine what files can be removed from the package folder. If those files have not changed, they will be removed. 
6. If everything is deleted from the package folder, the folder is also removed.


When a package has an exe file, Chocolatey will create a link "shortcut" to the file so that you can run that tool anywhere on the machine.
When a package has a chocolateyInstall.ps1, it will run the script. The instructions in the file can be anything. This is limited only by the .NET framework and PowerShell.
Most of the Chocolatey packages that take advantage of the PowerShell download an application installer and execute it silently.


## Where are Chocolatey packages installed to?

Chocolatey packages are installed to `ChocolateyInstall\lib`, but the software could go to various locations, depending on how the package maintainer created the package.

Some packages are installed under `ChocolateyInstall\lib`, others - especially packages that are based on Windows installers (.msi files) - install to the default path of the original installer (which is most likely within `Program Files`).

There are also packages for which you can set a custom installation path. These packages (like ruby) use the `$env:ChocolateyBinRoot` environment variable. If this variable does not exist, it will be created as `c:\tools` e.g. `C:\tools\ruby193`. To change this behaviour, you can set `$env:ChocolateyBinRoot` to an existing folder, e. g. `C:\somestuff`. Packages that use the environment variable, will then be installed in the given subfolder, f. ex. `C:\somestuff\ruby193`.

## Where does Chocolatey install packages from?
By default it installs packages from chocolatey.org (the community feed). But you can change this by adding default sources and/or using the  `--source` switch when running a command.
