# PowerShell Functions aka Helpers Reference

<!-- This documentation file is automatically generated from the files at $sourceFunctions using $($sourceLocation)GenerateDocs.ps1. Contributions are welcome at the original location(s). -->
## Main Functions

These functions call other functions and many times may be the only thing you need in your [[chocolateyInstall.ps1 file|ChocolateyInstallPS1]] or other special Chocolatey scripts. (You can find a complete list of Chocolately helper scripts and when they run [[here.|CreatePackages]])

* [[Install-ChocolateyPackage|HelpersInstallChocolateyPackage]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyZipPackage|HelpersInstallChocolateyZipPackage]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyPowershellCommand|HelpersInstallChocolateyPowershellCommand]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyVsixPackage|HelpersInstallChocolateyVsixPackage]]

## Error / Success Functions

* [[Write-ChocolateySuccess|HelpersWriteChocolateySuccess]] - **DEPRECATED**
* [[Write-ChocolateyFailure|HelpersWriteChocolateyFailure]] - **DEPRECATED**

You really don't need a try catch with Chocolatey PowerShell files anymore.

## More Functions

### Administrative Access Functions

When creating packages that need to run one of the following commands below, one should add the tag `admin` to the nuspec.

* [[Install-ChocolateyPackage|HelpersInstallChocolateyPackage]]
* [[Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin|HelpersStartChocolateyProcessAsAdmin]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage|HelpersInstallChocolateyInstallPackage]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyPath|HelpersInstallChocolateyPath]] - when specifying machine path
* [[Install-ChocolateyEnvironmentVariable|HelpersInstallChocolateyEnvironmentVariable]] - when specifying machine path
* [[Install-ChocolateyExplorerMenuItem|HelpersInstallChocolateyExplorerMenuItem]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyFileAssociation|HelpersInstallChocolateyFileAssociation]]

### Non-Administrator Safe Functions

When you have a need to run Chocolatey without Administrative access required (non-default install location), you can run the following functions without administrative access.

These are the functions from above as one list.

* [[Install-ChocolateyZipPackage|HelpersInstallChocolateyZipPackage]]

* [[Get-ChocolateyUnzip|HelpersGetChocolateyUnzip]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyPath|HelpersInstallChocolateyPath]] - when specifying user path
* [[Install-ChocolateyEnvironmentVariable|HelpersInstallChocolateyEnvironmentVariable]] - when specifying user path
* [[Install-ChocolateyDesktopLink|HelpersInstallChocolateyDesktopLink]] - **DEPRECATED** - see [[Install-ChocolateyShortcut|HelpersInstallChocolateyShortcut]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyPinnedTaskBarItem|HelpersInstallChocolateyPinnedTaskBarItem]]
* [[Install-ChocolateyShortcut|HelpersInstallChocolateyShortcut]] - v0.9.9+

## Variables

There are also a number of environment variables providing access to some values from the nuspec and other information that may be useful. They are accessed via `$env:variableName`.

### Environment Variables
Chocolatey makes a number of environment variables available (You can access any of these with $env:TheVariableNameBelow):

 * TEMP/TMP - Overridden to the CacheLocation, but may be the same as the original TEMP folder
 * ChocolateyInstall - Top level folder where Chocolatey is installed
 * ChocolateyPackageName - The name of the package, equivalent to the `<id />` field in the nuspec (0.9.9+)
 * ChocolateyPackageTitle - The title of the package, equivalent to the `<title />` field in the nuspec (0.10.1+)
 * ChocolateyPackageVersion - The version of the package, equivalent to the `<version />` field in the nuspec (0.9.9+)
 * ChocolateyPackageFolder - The top level location of the package folder - the folder where Chocolatey has downloaded and extracted the NuGet package, typically `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\packageName`.

#### Advanced Environment Variables
The following are more advanced settings:

 * ChocolateyPackageParameters - Parameters to use with packaging, not the same as install arguments (which are passed directly to the native installer). Based on `--package-parameters`. (0.9.8.22+)
 * CHOCOLATEY_VERSION - The version of Choco you normally see. Use if you are 'lighting' things up based on choco version. (0.9.9+) - Otherwise take a dependency on the specific version you need. 
 * ChocolateyForceX86 = If available and set to 'true', then user has requested 32bit version. (0.9.9+) - Automatically handled in built in Choco functions. 
 * OS_PLATFORM - Like Windows, OSX, Linux. (0.9.9+)
 * OS_VERSION - The version of OS, like 6.1 something something for Windows. (0.9.9+)
 * OS_NAME - The reported name of the OS. (0.9.9+)
 * IS_PROCESSELEVATED = Is the process elevated? (0.9.9+)
 * ChocolateyToolsLocation - formerly 'ChocolateyBinRoot' ('ChocolateyBinRoot' will be removed with Chocolatey v2.0.0), this is where tools being installed outside of Chocolatey packaging will go. (0.9.10+)

#### Set By Options and Configuration
Some environment variables are set based on options that are passed, configuration and/or features that are turned on:

 * ChocolateyEnvironmentDebug - Was `--debug` passed? If using the built-in PowerShell host, this is always true (but only logs debug messages to console if `--debug` was passed) (0.9.10+)
 * ChocolateyEnvironmentVerbose - Was `--verbose` passed? If using the built-in PowerShell host, this is always true (but only logs verbose messages to console if `--verbose` was passed). (0.9.10+)
 * ChocolateyForce - Was `--force` passed? (0.9.10+)
 * ChocolateyForceX86 - Was `-x86` passed? (CHECK)
 * ChocolateyRequestTimeout - How long before a web request will time out. Set by config `webRequestTimeoutSeconds` (CHECK)
 * ChocolateyResponseTimeout - How long to wait for a download to complete? Set by config `commandExecutionTimeoutSeconds` (CHECK)
 * ChocolateyPowerShellHost - Are we using the built-in PowerShell host? Set by `--use-system-powershell` or the feature `powershellHost` (0.9.10+)

#### Business Edition Variables

 * ChocolateyInstallArgumentsSensitive - Encrypted arguments passed from command line `--install-arguments-sensitive` that are not logged anywhere. (0.10.1+ and licensed editions 1.6.0+)
 * ChocolateyPackageParametersSensitive - Package parameters passed from command line `--package-parameters-senstivite` that are not logged anywhere.  (0.10.1+ and licensed editions 1.6.0+)

 * ChocolateyLicenseType - What edition / type of the licensed edition is installed?

 * CHOCOLATEY_VERSION_PRODUCT = the version of Choco that may match CHOCOLATEY_VERSION but may be different (0.9.9+) - based on git describe
 * IS_ADMIN = Is the user an administrator? But doesn't tell you if the process is elevated. (0.9.9+)

#### Not Useful Or Anti-Pattern If Used

 * ChocolateyInstallOverride = Not for use in package automation scripts. Based on `--override-arguments` being passed. (0.9.9+)
